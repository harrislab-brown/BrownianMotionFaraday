This folder contains scripts needed to both track the object and process the object's trajectory over time. We have also included an example trajectory that can be used with the two sets of code as an example.

To get started, place the two Jupyter notebooks and video(s) into a single folder. Then, run the `Processing_PhoneVideo.ipynb`. This will prompt the user to click on a few points of one of the videos in the folder. This will be used to mask out all of the background outside of the bath itself and initialize the object to track. The code will then run through all of the videos in the folder. This will result in two files being producted: a tracked object video that will show the object being tracked over time and a CSV file that contains the object's center of mass coordinates (x,y) in pixels. For here, you can now run `Processing_Object_Trajectory.ipynb`. This code will use a known conversion rate, measured by the user, to convert pixels to milimeters. The code will then compute the velocity of the object over time. The code will automatically loop through all CSVs that are in the folder.
